# TypeScript API Project

This is a TypeScript-based API project built using Node.js, featuring a relational database powered by Drizzle ORM, as well as SMS and email notifications, and scheduled tasks using Cron Jobs.

## Features

- **Drizzle ORM**: Manage and interact with your database in a type-safe manner.
- **SMS Notifications**: Send SMS messages using your preferred SMS provider (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo).
- **Nodemailer**: Send email notifications with customizable templates.
- **Cron Jobs**: Schedule recurring tasks, such as sending reports, reminders, or cleaning up data.

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or another relational database supported by Drizzle ORM)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   
2. Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Copy the .env.example to .env and update it with your environment variables:


3. Copy the .env.example to .env and update it with your environment variables:
cp .env.example .env
Ensure you have a PostgreSQL (or supported) database up and running.

Configuration
Configure your environment variables in the .env file.

Example .env:
env
## Exampl e.env

PORT=4000
# Database

REFRESH_TOKEN = 


JWT_SECRET=

# Cron Job Configuration

Database Setup
This project uses Drizzle ORM for database interaction.

Setup the database schema:

Define your schema using Drizzle in src/db/schema.ts.

typescript
Copy code
import { pgTable, serial, varchar, integer } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  email: varchar('email', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  age: integer('age').notNull(),
});
Run migrations: Drizzle ORM migrations can be run to apply schema changes to the database.

bash
Copy code
npm run migrate
SMS Notifications
This project uses a configurable SMS provider (like Twilio or Nexmo) to send SMS notifications. The SMS logic is abstracted in the src/services/smsService.ts file.

Example Usage:
typescript
Copy code
import { sendSMS } from './services/smsService';

sendSMS('+1234567890', 'Your order has been processed successfully!');
Update your .env file with the appropriate SMS provider API keys and secrets.

Email Notifications
Nodemailer is used to send emails from your application.

Example Usage:
typescript
Copy code
import { sendEmail } from './services/emailService';

sendEmail({
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome to our platform!',
  text: 'Hello, thank you for joining our platform.',
});
Ensure your .env file contains your SMTP settings for sending emails.

Cron Jobs
The project uses node-cron to schedule and run recurring tasks.

Example Cron Job:
A sample cron job can be set up in src/jobs/reportGenerator.ts to send out daily reports.

typescript
Copy code
import cron from 'node-cron';
import { generateReport } from './services/reportService';

cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', () => {
  console.log('Running daily report generation...');
  generateReport();
});
The cron job schedule is configured in .env using the CRON_SCHEDULE variable, or it can be directly set up in code.

Running the Server
Start the development server:

bash
npm run dev
Build the project for production:

bash
npm run build
Start the production server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
